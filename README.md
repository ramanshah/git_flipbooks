# Flipbooks from Intermediate Git, more permissively licensed

[`intermediate_git`](https://github.com/ramanshah/intermediate_git) is licensed
under a restrictive, infective CC-BY-NC-SA license. This license reflects
material the course used from Scott Chacon's _Pro Git_, which is licensed the
same way.

Since delivering this course in the academic sector in 2015, I've changed jobs,
and I've found that there is significant demand for this teaching material in
the private sector. However, the NC part of the license makes the material
legally dubious to use for internal corporate trainings. The flipbooks from Day
4 of Intermediate Git are my original work. I am thus choosing to re-release
this material under a more permissive CC-BY license so it can be more broadly
valuable.
